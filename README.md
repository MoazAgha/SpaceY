# Space Y
For this capstone project for the IBM Data Science Certificate, we will be working as data scientists for a private space launch company and applying our data science skills to the task of predicting the success of the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Our analysis will follow the data science methodology, including data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting our results to stakeholders.

Our specific objectives for this project include:

1- Collecting data from various sources and improving its quality through data wrangling.

2- Exploring the processed data and gaining insights through statistical analysis and data visualization.

3- Practicing our SQL skills by querying the data and identifying trends and patterns.

4- Splitting the data into groups based on categorical variables or factors in the data.

5- Building, evaluating, and refining predictive models to uncover more interesting insights.

6- Creating a presentation to communicate our analysis and findings to stakeholders in a clear and compelling way.


This project aims to address the important problem of predicting the success of rocket launches, and we hope to make significant contributions to the field of data science through our work. The final presentation will be developed into stories that highlight the key insights and recommendations that we have identified through our analysis.
