# SpaceY
A capstone project for the IBM Data Science Certificate. The project is related to a competitor of Space X, where we will apply data science skills as a Data scientist for this private space launch company. We will be tasked with predicting if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. The process follow the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting your results to stakeholders.  

Objectives: 
- Collecting data from various sources. 
- Improving the quality of data by performing data wrangling. 
- Exploring the processed data.
- Practicing SQL skills as we query the data and gather insights.
- Gaining insights into the data by applying statistical analysis and data visualization.
- Splitting the data into groups defined by categorical variables or factors in the data. 
- Building, evaluating, and refining predictive models for discovering more exciting insights.
- Finally, creating a presentation that will be developed into stories of all the analysis.
